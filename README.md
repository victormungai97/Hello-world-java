Brief introduction to setting up Java and running first program

Hi guys! 
So today, we shall we setting up Java for use as our programming language.
Please follow the steps carefully to avoid any mistakes along the way

1. ABOUT JAVA
   Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

  A term that we will be using is the jdk. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development
  
1. WHY JAVA
  a. It's widely used.
  b. It's open source meaning it's development kit is available and free
    for developers to use.
  c. It's platform independent hence can run on any computer regardless of
     hardware and software dependencies.
   d. It's portable as the program will run on an program's JRE once it has 
     
2. DOWNLOADING JAVA (as of 14/03/2017)
  1. Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html so as to get Java SE (Standard              Edition).
  2. Click on the radio button saying "Accept License Agreement" in the Java SE Development Kit 8u121
  3. Look for the file description that matches your computer and select it's corresponding JDK. If you are on Windows, visit http://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?ID=9405#top to determine your type of Windows.
  4. Once the jdk has been downloaded, click on the "Run" option or go to the folder where it was downloaded (probabl Downloads)
     and double click on it.
  5. A wizard will appear. Complete the steps given while preferably keeping the default options to complete the Java installation
     process.
